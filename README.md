> **Kubernetes was built for web apps. Clawbernetes is AI-native infrastructure management you talk to.**

Clawbernetes turns [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) into an intelligent infrastructure manager. Instead of YAML, dashboards, and `kubectl` — you have a conversation.

```
You:   "What GPUs do we have?"
Agent: "1 node connected — morpheus (Ubuntu 24.04, 16 CPUs, 32GB RAM).
        GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti, 4GB VRAM. No workloads running."

You:   "Deploy a vLLM server with Llama 3 8B, pick the best node."
Agent: "Deploying on morpheus (only node with GPU, 4GB VRAM available).
        Container started. Endpoint: http://morpheus:8000
        Health monitoring active."

You:   "Why is inference slow?"
Agent: "GPU 0 at 87°C — thermal throttling. Fan speed 100%.
        Ambient temp may be high. Want me to reduce batch size?"
```

## How It Works

Clawbernetes is a **full conversational replacement for Kubernetes** — same capabilities, none of the YAML.

Container orchestration, scheduling, health monitoring, autoscaling, config management, namespaces, resource quotas, jobs, cron, node management, policy enforcement, secrets, storage, and network policies — all driven by conversation instead of manifests.

### Just Tell It What You Need

**🚀 Deployments**
```
You:   "Deploy a vLLM server with Llama 3 70B on the node with the most VRAM"
Agent: Selects the best node, pulls the image, starts the container with GPU
       passthrough, and sets up health monitoring — all in one turn.
```

**🔍 Diagnostics**
```
You:   "Why is inference slow on morpheus?"
Agent: Checks GPU temps, VRAM usage, CPU load, and container stats.
       "GPU 0 at 89°C — thermal throttling. Want me to reduce batch size?"
```

**📊 Fleet Overview**
```
You:   "What GPUs do we have across the cluster?"
Agent: Queries every connected node and returns a full inventory — GPU models,
       VRAM, utilization, temps, and running workloads per node.
```

**🔐 Secrets Management**
```
You:   "Store the HuggingFace token as a secret and rotate it monthly"
Agent: Encrypts with AES-256-GCM, stores on the node, and sets up a cron
       rotation schedule. No Vault needed.
```

**⚖️ Autoscaling**
```
You:   "Scale the inference server between 2 and 8 replicas based on queue depth"
Agent: Creates an autoscale policy, monitors the metric, and adjusts replicas
       automatically. Reports scaling events to you in chat.
```

**🛡️ Incident Response**
```
You:   "Node gpu-03 just went offline. What happened?"
Agent: Checks last heartbeat, reviews logs, identifies the failure.
       "OOM killed at 14:32 — workload exceeded 79GB VRAM. Restarted with limits."
```

**🌐 Networking**
```
You:   "Set up a network policy so only the API gateway can talk to the database"
Agent: Creates ingress/egress rules isolating the database service. WireGuard
       mesh keeps traffic encrypted between nodes.
```

**💰 MOLT Marketplace**
```
You:   "I need 4 A100s for 6 hours. Find the cheapest spot on MOLT."
Agent: Scans the P2P marketplace, verifies hardware attestation, escrows MOLT
       tokens, and provisions the GPUs. Pay only for what you use.
```

### Architecture

- **OpenClaw Gateway** = the control plane
- **OpenClaw Nodes** = agents on each machine
- **`clawnode` binary** = system detection, metrics, container management, node identity
- **Clawbernetes Skills** = teach the agent infrastructure ops, deployment, scaling, diagnostics
- **Clawbernetes Plugin** = fleet-level orchestration, multi-node inventory, smart placement
- **MOLT Network** = P2P compute marketplace (buy/sell idle resources)

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install OpenClaw (the control plane)

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

### 2. Build clawnode (on each node machine)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawbernetes/clawbernetes
cd clawbernetes
cargo install --path crates/clawnode
```

### 3. Connect a node to the gateway

Generate a config, then run:

```bash
# Generate config
clawnode init-config \
  --gateway ws://gateway-host:18789 \
  --output ./clawnode-config.json

# Edit config — set token, hostname, etc.
vim clawnode-config.json

# Run the node agent
clawnode run --config ./clawnode-config.json
```

Approve the node from the gateway:

```bash
openclaw nodes pending
openclaw nodes approve <requestId>
```

The node will complete the challenge-response handshake and show as `paired · connected`.

### 4. Install skills and plugin

```bash
# Skills (on the gateway machine)
cp -r skills/* ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/

# Plugin (optional — adds fleet-level tools)
openclaw plugins install --link ./plugin/openclaw-clawbernetes
openclaw gateway restart
```

### 5. Talk to your infrastructure

```
"What GPUs do we have?"
"How's the cluster looking?"
"What's running on morpheus?"
"Deploy nginx on the node with the most free RAM."
"GPU temps across the cluster."
"Show me kernel versions on all nodes."
```

No command syntax needed. The agent translates your intent into the right API calls.

## OpenClaw Plugin

The `plugin/openclaw-clawbernetes/` directory contains a TypeScript OpenClaw plugin that adds fleet-level orchestration on top of the per-node commands:

**Tools:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `claw_fleet_status` | Aggregate cluster health, GPU count, memory, workloads |
| `claw_gpu_inventory` | All GPUs across all nodes with specs |
| `claw_deploy` | Auto-place workload on the best node based on available resources |
| `claw_workloads` | Cross-node workload list |
| `claw_multi_invoke` | Fan-out any command to multiple nodes in parallel |

**Services:**
- `clawbernetes-health-monitor` — background fleet health monitoring with state transition tracking

**Gateway RPC:**
- `clawbernetes.fleet-status` — cached fleet status for the Control UI dashboard

Install:

```bash
openclaw plugins install --link ./plugin/openclaw-clawbernetes
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "gateway": "ws://gateway.example.com:18789",
  "token": "your-gateway-auth-token",
  "hostname": "gpu-node-01",
  "labels": {},
  "state_path": "/var/lib/clawnode/state",
  "heartbeat_interval_secs": 30,
  "reconnect_delay_secs": 5,
  "container_runtime": "docker",
  "network_enabled": false,
  "region": "us-west",
  "wireguard_listen_port": 51820,
  "ingress_listen_port": 8443
}
```

Generate a starter config:

```bash
clawnode init-config --gateway ws://your-gateway:18789 --output config.json
```

## Gateway Setup

To allow clawnode commands through the OpenClaw gateway, add them to the node command allowlist in `openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "nodes": {
      "allowCommands": [
        "system.info", "gpu.list", "gpu.metrics",
        "workload.run", "workload.stop", "workload.list",
        "workload.logs", "workload.inspect", "workload.stats",
        "container.exec", "node.health", "node.capabilities",
        "deploy.*", "secret.*", "volume.*", "backup.*",
        "auth.*", "autoscale.*", "config.*", "job.*",
        "cron.*", "namespace.*", "policy.*", "network.*",
        "service.*", "ingress.*", "metrics.*", "audit.*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

By default, only `system.run` and `system.which` are allowed for Linux nodes.

## MOLT Network

The P2P GPU compute marketplace. Providers offer idle GPUs, buyers pay in MOLT tokens (Solana SPL).

```
Provider: "I have 4×A100 idle for the next 6 hours"
Buyer:    "I need 4×A100 for distributed training"
MOLT:     Escrow → Attestation → Execute → Settle
```

## Development

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Run all tests (1,866 tests)
cargo test --workspace

# Release build
cargo build --workspace --release

# Run clawnode locally
cargo run -p clawnode -- run --config ./config.json
```
